# Practical 07
This repository contains my practical work for the CP1404 Subject: Programming II.  
Each week, I completed Python exercises and small projects to learn about functions, classes, clean code, and more.
This week I completed prac_07 task.

## About Me

I'm Junjie Chu, an CP1404 student learning Python at JCU.  
I enjoy applying code to real-world tasks and improving my logical thinking.

## What I've Learned About Clean Code

- The importance of meaningful variable and function names.
- Keeping functions short, focused, and doing one thing.
- Writing reusable and maintainable code through proper structure and formatting.
