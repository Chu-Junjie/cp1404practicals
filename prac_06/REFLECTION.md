## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

To enhance my coding process, I'll first design the program's logical flow on paper, 
then implement it in PyCharm, while verifying each functional block works correctly before proceeding.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to optimize my coding speed by improving time management, as my current pace could hinder exam performance.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Watch lecturer videos before lessons and submitting work on time.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

To manage my time and do not submit work near due date.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Lecturer's style so good.
